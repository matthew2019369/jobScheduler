Job Scheduler in simulated distrbiuted system

# Introduction
This is a stage to perform job scheduling procedure to successfully allocate jobs to servers based on memory allocation policies
in operating systems. Each memory allocation policy has unique algorithm to select ideal server for each job assignment. In this 
task, each team member is expected to design and implement accurate algorithm based on individual memory allocation policy, in 
order to produce identical output generated by defaulted client application.
